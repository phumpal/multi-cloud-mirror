# Multi-Cloud-Mirror #

## Description ##
multi-cloud-mirror provides an easy, multi-processing way of synchronizing a bucket at Amazon S3 to a container at Rackspace Cloud Files, or vice versa.  It is written and maintained by Joe Masters Emison, reachable by email at joe at buildfax dot com.

## Installation ##
multi-cloud-mirror should work with all versions of python from 2.7 onward (tested with 2.7.1), and will probably work with earlier versions as well (potentially with some modifications).  multi-cloud-mirror was developed with the following modules:

```
easy_install python-cloudfiles==1.7.9.1
easy_install boto==1.9b
easy_install argparse
```

You will also need to install configuration files on the local system for multi-cloud-mirror to work:

**/etc/boto.cfg** (or **~/.boto**):
```
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = <aws_access_key_id>
aws_secret_access_key = <aws_secret_access_key>
```

**/etc/cloudfiles.cfg**:
```
[Credentials]
username = <username>
api_key = <api_key>
```

## Running Multi-Cloud-Mirror ##
**Options**
```

positional arguments:
  "s3://bucket->cf://container"
                        a synchronization scenario, of the form
                        "s3://bucket->cf://container" or
                        "cf://container->s3://bucket"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --process NUMPROCESSES
                        number of simultaneous file upload threads to run
  --maxsize MAXFILESIZE
                        maximium file size to sync, in bytes (files larger
                        than this size will be skipped)
  --from EMAILDEST      email address from which to send the status email;
                        must be specified to receive message
  --to EMAILSRC         email address(es) (comma-separated) to which to send
                        the status email; must be specificed to recieve
                        message
  --subject EMAILSUBJ   subject of the status email
  --tmpfile TMPFILE     temporary file used for writing when sending from cf
                        to s3
  --debug DEBUG         turn on debug output
```

**Example**
```
./multi-cloud-mirror.py  --process 3 --from 'joe@someplace.com' --to 'joe@someplace.com,joe@someotherplace.com' 's3://myS3bucket->cf://myCFContainer' 'cf://myCFContainer->s3://myOtherS3Bucket'
```

## Using Lockrun ##
I prefer running the Multi-Cloud-Mirror script with lockrun, which will make sure that no other instance of multi\_cloud\_mirror.py is running.  The source code to lockrun (which is in the public domain) is available from the download page here.

**Example in crontab**
```
30 */4 * * * root /usr/local/bin/lockrun --lockfile=/var/run/mcm.lockrun -- /usr/local/bin/multi-cloud-mirror.py  --process 3 --from 'joe@someplace.com' --to 'joe@someplace.com,joe@someotherplace.com' 's3://myS3bucket->cf://myCFContainer' 'cf://myCFContainer->s3://myOtherS3Bucket'
```

## Other Notes ##
  * When you run the script, you may occasionally encounter this error at the end of the script: `<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: 'NoneType' object is not callable`.  This is a known multiprocessing bug (http://bugs.python.org/issue4106.), which has not been fixed in some versions of Python/multiprocessing library.  It has no impact on the successful running of the script; it doesn't come until the script is done with what it needs to do.
  * This script is best used with [RightScale](http://www.rightscale.com/) and its companion [Multi-Cloud Mirror ServerTemplate](https://my.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/Multi-Cloud-Storage-Mirroring-/26557) and [RightScript](https://my.rightscale.com/library/right_scripts/Set-Up-and-Run-Multi-Cloud-Mir/26556).  Additionally, I have made available [a very detailed howto guide](http://multi-cloud-mirror.googlecode.com/files/How_to_Set_up_a_Multi-Cloud_Mirror_Server.pdf).
